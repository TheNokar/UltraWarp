Warp Compass
=========
What is the Warp Compass? Well the warp compass is a Custom Inventory that will pop up every time you right click the "My Warps" Compass or what ever you rename it too. When the custom inventory is opened you will get a list of all your and public warps and to warp you simply click the page where your warp is. And also the compass is multi page so if you have 100 warps there will only be displayed 26 items per page. You click the "Next" Arrow to go to the next page and click the "Back" Arrow to go back a page
