UltraWarp
=========

The ultimate bukkit warp plugin

Commands
=========
/warp add/set/create <Warp Name> | to create a warp
/warp <Warp name> | to warp
/warp remove/rem <Warp name> | to remove warps
/warp modify <Warp name> <parameter> | There is only one parameter now that is setpos/pos
/warp list | Get list of all off your warps!

And also you get a compass that contains all your warps and public warps. And the only thing you need to do is clicking the warp name to warp.
